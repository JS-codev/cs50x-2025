Reflection

If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, I would characterize their audio aura by calculating the average energy, valence, and danceability of those songs. For example, if the average energy and danceability are high, the listener likely enjoys upbeat and lively music, whereas a lower valence might indicate a preference for more somber or melancholic tones. Together, these averages create a numerical summary that reflects the general mood and style of the listener’s music preferences.

However, this method may not fully represent the listener’s true audio aura. Using just the top 100 songs from one year may omit the listener’s broader tastes, seasonal changes, or context for why certain songs were played more (e.g., work vs. workout playlists). Also, averaging the metrics assumes that each song contributes equally to the listener’s mood, ignoring how often a song was played or the emotional impact it had.

To improve this, I would propose weighting each song’s contribution to the aura by the number of plays, so frequently played songs influence the average more. Additionally, segmenting songs by listening context or time of day could reveal different “auras” for different moods or activities. Another approach could be to include more nuanced audio features or listener feedback to capture the emotional resonance beyond the numeric attributes.

Overall, while averaging key audio features is a good starting point, more sophisticated and personalized metrics would yield a richer, more accurate representation of a listener’s audio aura.
